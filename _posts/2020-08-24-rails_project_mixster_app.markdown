I designed an app named Mixster for people who bar hop. Bar Hoppers can take a picture, fill out the drink ingredients, bar name and location, bartenders name and taste profile of the drink. Then give the drink a review of 5 or less star and a written comment.

THE GOOD. THE BAD. THE UGLY (l love a Clint Eastwood theme)

The Good:
   I love RAILS, out of all our programming software and lessons, rails is my favorite. If you use scaffolding(which the requirements ask you NOT TOO) the folders set up is similar to your sinatra project. I took the time out to manually set up the folders in Sinatra, which would have made this task easier. The seamlessness and diversity you have with rails gems, and Javascript the creative and design possiblities are infinte. I would say pick a really creative project and have fun with it. If you need help brainstorming... youtube 12 apps in 12 weeks. TREMENDOUS amount of help
	 
	 
The Bad: 
  The model relationship requirements are tricky. I had to get a lot of help and do a lot of planning to make sure that my project met all of the requirements. My advise is choose 2 things that work thru a 3rd thing and go from there. Example can be Home Owner and Painter.. which Jobs connects them. Rooms, materials, or properties can be used to segregate instances. 
	
The Ugly: 
  I got really creative and tried to implement a lot of features in my app. Some of the implementations gave me a lot of trouble and I ended up spending a lot of time fixing them. The 3rd party sign up, search feature and raty (the star rating system) gave me a hell of a time to code in. Im always in favor of getting creative, but if it takes up too much of your time KISS(keep it short and simple)
	
	
In conclusion, I really enjoyed this project, I wish I had more time to implement more things on it. Even after the due date I would be putting finishing touches on it... Changing color scheme and what not! Have fun!

Happy Coding
