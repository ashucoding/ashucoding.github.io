The methods I use to learn coding methods


  ``Before deciding to learn how to code, I was in finance for 12 years and prior to signing up to bootcamp, I had zero coding experience. As a newbie, coding was such a completely different language compared to finance, thus I struggled a lot with the concepts, the acromoyns, the shortcuts and to top it all off, I wasn't the world's greatest typist.. Hell I'm not even the world's most intermeditate typist. 

``Bootcamp being imersive, I knew I had to develop a way to retain and process the information quickly and efficiently. In the beginning, I tried reading thru the information and asking for as much help as I could have possibly ask for without annoying anyone and I found this process to not only frustrating but time consuming. 
```

```Then I started to reflect on my old study habits from college. The best way to retain information quickly is first and foremost is knowing your learning pattern. From previously being in school I knew I best learned in repetition and visual instructions. I quickly started researching step by step videos for lessons that I was struggling with. The internet offers an abundance of instructional step by step videos that will walk you thru specific coding languages. I found that this learning method allows me the retain steps and information but watching multiple instructional videos of the same lesson until I found an instructor that I was comfortable following. Even though this sounds time consuming, it actually took me less than 3 hours of instructional videos that allowed me to complete 3 or 4 modules of labs on the matter of hours. Compared to struggling thru the labs myself which would have taken days or even weeks. 

The second step is actual learning the concepts or methods at hand not the lesson. I was trying so hard to solve the puzzle and not learn how to solve the puzzle. It is ok, if you don't always get the results of the code perfect, what matters most is that you understand how to use the method or methods to produce results. Once you focus on getting the methods and concepts down, the actual coding becomes easier and you become more receptive to pick up coding patterns.

Happy Coding!
