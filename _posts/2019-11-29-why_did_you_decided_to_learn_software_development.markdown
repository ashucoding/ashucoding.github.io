##### “Delete your Ex, Shutdown your Crush, Format your past, Reprogram your heart, and Restart your life” –unknown

**The Past:**  
It was the spring of 2017, I was in my apartment taking a survey of my life. So let’s see, shall we? I was laid off from my job 2 months’ prior (check), found out my husband “ain’t shit” (check), my house looked like an episode of hoarders (check) and I was bored to death with my career choice (check). Everything I valued in my life, my career, my family, my home had lost all value to me. I needed to restart my life and fast. Like 80 percent of Americans, I felt the dooming feeling of being “stuck in a rut”. That feeling where I had reach an impasse with life, my life. I couldn’t fight it. I had to just let it consume me and take it for what it was worth… a life lesson, a chapter in a book before the story climax. 


**The Present.**  
The first step I learned, from years of reading self improvement books, is to find the courage to physically remove yourself from your environment. I physically left everything I had built for the past seven years, my home, my marriage, and my life. If anyone is actually reading this and considering this step: **THIS IS ONE OF THE HARDEST THING IVE EVER HAD TO DO. LET GO!!! **


The second step was to find a source of income; I went back to work with a purpose. At this point, I was out of work for almost 12 months and I had a lot of time to soul search and decided what I actually wanted out of life. Which motivated me to go back into the field that I had grown a great disdain for.
```

And finally the last step, build a better future and that meant creating a stream of income for the lifestyle I wanted to attain. I tried my hand at many different things before I actually started writing down what I wanted from life. My main goal was Growth and Stability. And after figuring out the “What” I did some research on the “How”.


**The Future.** 
Why did I choose Software Development? Because I am crazy, I’m only kidding…. Eh half kidding. Since I already knew what I wanted in my next career, it was easy enough to choose a career that would compliment my financial background, have room to grow in the field, provide job security, allow me to make a certain income to be comfortable, yet also be flexible enough if I decided to work remotely. After months of searching and trying different things, I discovered an app called “Career Karma”, which walked me thru the steps on how to become a software engineer. The platform offered information, guidance and the thing I needed most, SUPPORT!  Even though, I am at the beginning of my journey and it’s been a struggle at the very least but I keep telling myself “I CAN DO THIS!” and that’s because I have a great support system. 
It has been 2 years, since I started reprogramming my life, and honestly I have a long way to go, and the journey is not only long but its hard. I am in it for the long haul, because “nothing good, comes easy”.
