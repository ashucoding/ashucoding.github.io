THE GOOD. THE BAD. THE UGLY

```

```First project of the course is the CLI Data Gem. This project purpose is to embody all of the lessons learned in Obeject Oriented Ruby, specifically focusing on methods, calls, and from more recent lessons, scraping information from a website of your choice. The objective of the project is to build a Ruby Gem with CLI completed with licenses, bundles, and all the components to execute your program. 

```

```My personal experience of this project, if I had to rate on a scale of 1-10 (bad-worst), would be about a 6. I have complied my experience into 3 categories, thanks to Clint Eastwood, labeled THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY.  So without further ado, lets get into it.

THE GOOD: First and foremost... There is a lot of help available for this project. There are study groups, private tutoring, one-one pairing, other students from different cohort, and a number of videos listed on instructors.learn.co. Avi, one fo learn.co developers, has numerous of videos to help you get started on this project. Another good thing about this project is the planning. Learn.co offers a planning guide and video that helps you streamling your project. This guide helps you pick a topic and write an outline of how you want the program to execute. And the last thing that I absolutely enjoyed about the project is the concept of scraping. While I struggled a little bit with the actual method of scraping, I loved the idea of pulling a lot of information from a website without actually typing it into the program.

THE BAD: When I started writing the codes for my project, I only used 2 folders based on how I set the program to execute. My bin folder, I set up a controller file which I would execute my program from and my cli folder which contained my actual code. I first wrote the code in "long form" with little use of sythax more words than code. This way I wanted to see if the code actually work before combining and simplifying them. I did have a little trouble simplyfing the code, this actually took a little bit of time to get it to work. especially around the scraping as I mentioned above. Once the code was simplified, it was smooth sailing from there. 

THE UGLY: Within my last lessons, I really struggled with setting up my models. So it was natural that when I started to work on my project that this was the most difficult part for me. Actually getting my folders and CLI commands proper and in order so that my code can execute took the most time. Avi have videos which help thru the process, however it can still be difficult. I recommend seeking tutors or coed to help thru this process. Do not take a lot of time of this process, because it is just the beginning on the project. My mistake is that, I took almost 2 days, trying to figure this out. Get help as soon as you can and the rest of the project will be smoothe sailing.

In conclusion, GOOD LUCK and HAPPY CODING!
